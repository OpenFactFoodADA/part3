For each section, we focus on two different parameters: <br>
- origins: represent the origin of the raw ingredients present in the final product. <br>
- manufacturing places: represent where the raw ingredients are transformed into the final product.<br><br></b>

Only the 20 countries with the most information relative to the products were analyzed for two major reasons: <br>
- The computational time needed to process more countries would have been too important to analyze all the data.<br>
- The remaining countries have not enough data to make a statistical assumption.<br><br>

For the first part, an external library, Geopy, was used in order to give the coordinates of the different address given and then the distance was calculated relative to the middle of the country. However, Geopy allow only a small amount of request. For this reason, only the 20 most frequent address per country were taken into account. After calculating the distance of each address, a weighted arithmetic mean of the distance was calculated with respect to the number of times this address appeared. This process was performed on the 20 countries both for the manufacturing places and the origins.<br><br>

For the second part, another external library, babel, was used in order to make a list of countries names in different languages. This was performed because the data were not clean and were written in different languages. Each time a country name was given in the manufacturing places or origins the data was saved. We calculate the proportion of occurrence of the name of the country for each given country. For instance, if the country is Switzerland we look at the proportion of time the name Switzerland (independent to the language or isocode given) appear in the address with respect to the total address where at least one piece of information was given. This gives a representation on how the country produces its own food. A pie chart for each country was displayed in the map as well, relating the top 5 countries in proportion of address. This process was performed on the 20 countries both for the manufacturing places and the origins. .<br><br>

		On this first map we observe that the countries that have the biggest part of their products manufactured locally are:<br>
- Mexico (70.38%), that was a real surprise for us.<br>
- Russia (70.22%), Australia (53.29%) and Canada (45.44%), that is more logical, because those are very big countries. Furthermore, Australia is quite isolated from the other countries.<br>
-And three European countries: Spain (58.47%), Germany (57.75%) and France (47.94%).
We observe that Spain, that was already noticed in the first part for its high proportion of healthy (grade A) products, is now noticed for its high proportion of locally manufactured goods.<br>
The countries that have the lowest part of their products manufactured locally are:<br>
-The United States (20.91%), despite its very big superficy.<br>
-Netherlands (13.10%)<br>
-And Switzerland (16.89%): this was the most surprising information that came out of this graph. Indeed, we always had the feeling that Switzerland was trying to offer the most local products as possible. Either this stereotype is not so true, either those ‘typical Swiss products made in Switzerland’ are not present yet on the OpenFactFood platform. <br>
However, we observe that the countries displayed by the pie chart for Switzerland are mostly very close countries (ex: Germany and France). We observe the same thing for Netherlands, but not for the United States.<br><br>

		This results displayed by this map are very similar to the first one:<br><br>

We observe that the countries that have the biggest part of local ingredients are:<br>
- Mexico (74.2%)<br>
- Russia (49.38%), Australia (49.80%) and Canada (48.73%).<br>
-And four European countries: Romania (53.55%), Portugal (50.30 %), Spain (44.82%) and France (45.16%).<br>
We observe that Romania, that was noticed in the first part for its high proportion of unhealthy (grade E) products, is now noticed for its high proportion of local ingredients.
Germany, that had very good values in terms of manufacturing places, in the first part, is not that good in this second part.<br>
The countries that have the lowest part of local ingredients are:<br>
-The United States (23.81%)<br>
-Netherlands (11.01%)<br>
-And Switzerland (14.77%): those observations are exactly the same as for the first part.<br><br>

-‘Small’ distances (between 500 and 1600km) are obtained for the European countries, excepted for Spain (~2190km), Netherlands (~2738km),  Hungary (~1959km) and Ireland (~3770km).<br>
-Very big distances are obtained for North America and Australia (between 4500 and 5500km).<br>
-The smallest distances are observed for Italy (~553km), Switzerland (~572km), and Romania (~658km).<br><br>

<br>
<br>
<b>It seems that for very big countries (in term of superficy), the proportion of products manufactured locally as well as the local ingredient proportion are quite high (more than 45%), excepted for the United States. But, due to these big country sizes and remoteness from the other countries, the distances the ingredients and goods need to travel before being sold are very high. <br>
In Europe, two countries have very good results both in terms of local manufacturing proportions and distances travelled after manufacturing: Germany and France. Furthermore, it seems that a lot of different countries have a significant proportion of products manufactured in Germany, including far away countries.<br>
In terms of origins, the most noticeable European country that displays good results both for the local proportions and in terms of travelling distance is Romania.<br>
For Switzerland, we had very bad results in terms of locally manufactured products proportion, as well as local ingredients proportions, but very good results in term of distances travelled. Indeed, it seems that Switzerland cares about proximity, but may be too small to be able to produce all its products. This could also be due to economic reasons, at least partially.<br>
